this file is intended to be used as a description of how this game engine is made from scratch. This engine is all open source, feel free to take it, change it and use it as you wish. if you want, contact me, I'm a beginner in the world of rendering, so all suggestions are welcome. if this library was useful, please, consider making a donation. Thanks and good use

### INTENTION

this engine is intended to be more like a library, very lightweight, without the use of any additional external libraries. Also, the engine's purpose is to be beginner friendly, something like **microsoft make code arcade**. Check in the **prova** folder to see the latest version of the renderer. all the other folders are not required actually, except for **matrix**

### NEXT STEPS

- [ ] webgpu texture
- [ ] webgpu uniforms
- [ ] re-implement the WebGL renderer
- [ ] implement lights 
- [ ] implement skeletal animations
- [ ] implement a fallback system with possibility of require specific api for the renderer
